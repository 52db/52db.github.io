## 去机场接人(Meeting People)

### (一)	会话

#### 对话1(Dialogue 1)

A: Excuse me, but are you Mr. Brown from America?	

B: Yes, I’m William Brown.

A: My name is Chang Fang. I’m an interpreter from the Beijing Foreign Studies University.	

B: How do you do? I’m very glad to meet you. (They shake hands)

A: How do you do? Welcome to China, Mr. Brown. We hope you will find your stay here satisfactory.

B: Thank you. I’m sure I will. It was very kind of you to come and meet me.

A: Not at all. We’re happy to have you here. Let me help you with your suitcase.

B: I can manage. Thank you all the same.

A: Shall we go to the waiting room? It’s just over there.

B: All right.

A: This way, please.

#### 对话2(Dialogue 2)

A: Anything dutiable?

B: Yes. I bought a watch in Hong Kong, which costs U.S. $50 and a new suit, U.S. $50.

A: Anything else besides these?

B: No, except the two bottles of whisky and a carton of cigarettes.

A: You are allowed U.S. $100 duty-free, so you don’t have to pay any duty on your watch and suit.

B: Do I have to pay duty on the liquor and cigarettes?

A: No. The law permits you to bring in two bottles of wine or liquor and a carton of cigarettes duty-free.

B: Oh, thank you very much.

#### 对话3(Dialogue 3)

A: Could you let me have your passport? Please fill in this form to make a record of any foreign currency you have.

B: Certainly. And then we go through Customs, I suppose?

B: Oh, No, there’s no Customs for invited guests.

B: That’s very nice, I must say. There I’ve finished filling out this form. What do we do next?

A: We’ll just see about your luggage. Would you mind coming over to identify your things?

B: These they are, near that pile over there. A black suitcase and a black leather bag. Two pieces only.

A: Fine. If you’ll give me your luggage check, I’ll get them for you.

B: Thank you, that’s great.
