# Chapter 1 Win Freedom 赢得自由

Man can only be free through mastery of himself.

只有通过掌握自己，才能使自己得到解放。

——S. E. Morison（莫里森）

## 1. Freedom parrot  呼喊自由的鹦鹉         

A man, a great man, a fighter for freedom was traveling in the mountains. He stayed in a caravans① for the night. He was amazed that in the caravans there was a beautiful parrot in a golden cage, continually repeating “Freedom! Freedom!”. And it was such a place that when the parrot repeated the word “Freedom!” it would go on echoing in the valleys, in the mountains.

The man thought: “I have seen many parrots, and I have thought they must want to be free from those cages... but I have never seen such a parrot whose whole day, from the morning to the evening when he goes to sleep, is spent in calling out for freedom.” He had an idea. In the middle of the night, when the owner was fast asleep, he got up and opened the door of the cage. He whispered to the parrot, “Now get out.”
But he was very surprised that the parrot was clinging to the bars of the cage. He said to him again and again, “Have you forgotten about freedom? Just get out! The door is open and the owner is fast asleep; nobody will ever know. You just fly into the sky; the whole sky is yours.”

But the parrot was clinging so deeply, so hard, that the man said, “What is the matter? Are you mad?” He tried to take the parrot out with his own hands, but the parrot started pecking② at him, and at the same time he was shouting, “Freedom! Freedom!” The valleys in the night echoed and re-echoed, but the man was also stubborn③; he was a freedom fighter.

He pulled the parrot out and threw him into the sky; and he was very satisfied, although his hand was hurt. The parrot had attacked him as forcefully as he could, but the man was immensely satisfied that he had made a soul free. He went to sleep.

In the morning, as the man was waking up, he heard the parrot shouting, “Freedom! Freedom!” He thought perhaps the parrot must be sitting on a tree or on a rock. But when he came out, the parrot was sitting in the cage. The door was open.

① caravan [ˈkærəvæn] n. 商队大旅店

② peck [pek] v. 啄

③ stubborn [ˈstʌbərn] a. 顽固的，固执的

一个人，一个了不起的人，一个为了自由而战的斗士，正在山峦间穿行。今晚他留在一个大旅店里过夜。旅店里有一个金鸟笼，里面有一只漂亮的鹦鹉在不停地反复呼喊着“自由！自由！”，这让他很震惊。那里是这样的一种地方，当这只鹦鹉不断地反复呼喊“自由！”的时候，这个词便会在山峦间、在深谷中久久回荡。

这个人想：“我看到过很多鹦鹉，也曾想过他们一定想从这些笼子里飞出去获得自由……但是，我从没有见过这样的鹦鹉，从早到晚，直到入睡，一整天都在呼喊着自由。”他有了一个想法……午夜，当店主熟睡的时候，他悄悄起身，打开了鸟笼门，小声地对鹦鹉说：“现在，出去吧。”

但是令他吃惊的是这只鹦鹉竟抓着鸟笼的横木不放。他对它一遍又一遍地说：“你忘了自由了吗？快出去！门开着，店主熟睡着，没有人会看到。你只要飞向天空，整片天空就是你的了。”

但是鹦鹉仍然牢牢地用力抓着横木不放，于是他说：“怎么了？你疯了吗？”他试图用手把鹦鹉弄出来，但是鹦鹉却开始啄他，同时大喊：“自由！自由！”深夜的山谷里荡起了一声又一声的回音，可是这个人也一样地顽固，谁让他是个自由之士呢。

他把鹦鹉拽出来，扔向空中。他很满意，尽管他的手受伤了。虽然鹦鹉全力地攻击他，但是他却心满意足，因为他使得一个灵魂自由了。他便回去继续睡他的觉。

早上，他睡醒了，听见鹦鹉正在大喊：“自由！自由！”他想也许鹦鹉正落在一棵树上或一块石头上呢。但当他出来的时候，鹦鹉正在笼子里，笼门还开着。

懂得什么是真正的自由，再去渴望和呼喊自由。

## 2. Digging a way out 挖一条出路 

There’s a man who has been by himself in a prison cell with a dirty floor, crude stone walls, and there’re two windows one of which looks out towards the ocean. He hears a scratching noise, and he looks down at the ground that is furthest away from the window facing the ocean. He sees the ground moving, and he starts to think he’s losing his mind. But soon the ground breaks, and up pops① a head with long hair and a beard... it’s a prisoner.

And the prisoner says, “Ssh. Listen. A group of us have been tunneling② for about six years, and we’ve finally reached your cell. We have ways to cover up my entrance into this, but now it’s all on your shoulders, man. All you have to do,” he said while pointing out the window towards the ocean, “you just start digging here and go down about six feet and about 75 feet in that direction and there is freedom, and we’re out of here!”

“Oh, I love that! That’s great; I want to be free!”

“Okay, I’ll check back with you in a few weeks.”

Two weeks later, the prisoner returns to check on his friend’s progress, and his friend nods back with great affirmation③, “Yeah, I’ve done it.”

So the man who was providing the instructions pops down the hole, and two seconds later pops right back up and says, “What have you done?”

“Huh?”

“I told you to dig in the direction towards the ocean! This tunnel that you dug goes back under the wall and into the prison yard.”

“Well, the digging was easier in the other direction...”  

① pop [pɑ:p] v. 突然伸出

② tunnel [ˈtʌnəl] v. 挖地道

③ affirmation [æfə'meɪʃn] n. 断言，肯定

一个人独自关在一间牢房里，牢房的地面脏兮兮的，石头墙壁很粗糙，有两扇窗户，其中一扇面向着大海。这个人听到了噼噼啪啪的声音，他望过去，发现远处对着那扇朝海的窗户的地面竟然在动，他开始认为自己疯了。但是不久之后地面裂开了，突然冒出来一个脑袋，带着长长的头发和胡子……是一个囚犯。

这个囚犯说：“嘘！听着，我们一群人一直在挖这个地道，差不多六年了，终于挖到了你的牢房。我们自有办法掩盖通往这里的入口，但是现在看你的了，老兄。你所要做的是，”他指着面朝大海的窗户说，“你只要开始从这里挖然后向下六英尺，朝那个方向大约75英尺，那里就是自由，我们就会从这里出去了！”

“哦，我喜欢！那太棒了，我要自由！”

“好的，几周之后我会过来看看。”

两周之后，这个囚犯回来检查他这位朋友的进程，他的朋友很肯定地向他点头：“耶，我完成了。”

于是，提供指示的这个人突然跳进洞里，两秒后又突然伸出了脑袋：“你都干了什么？”

“嗯？”

“我告诉你朝着大海的方向挖！你挖的这条地道从墙下穿过又回到了监狱的院子里。”

“哦，朝着其它的方向挖起来比较容易……”

或许你正囚禁于不自由的牢笼，挖一条出路，一定要朝着自由的方向。

## 3. Is man free? 人是自由的吗?

A man comes to a master to ask how much man is independent, free. Is he totally free, or is there a limitation? Is there something like fate, kismet①, destiny, God who makes a limitation beyond which you cannot be free?

The master said, “Stand up.”

The man must have felt this was a stupid kind of answer, “I am asking a simple question and he is asking me to stand up.” But he stood. And the master said, “Now, raise one of your legs up.”

The man, by this time must have been thinking he had come to a madman; what has this to do with freedom, independence? But now that he has come... and the master was so respected; not to follow him would be disrespectful②, and there was no harm. So he lifted one of his legs from the earth, one foot was in the air and he was standing on one foot.

And then the master said, “That’s perfectly good. Just one more thing, now take the left foot up also.”

“That is impossible!” the man said, “You are asking something impossible. I have taken my right foot up. Now I cannot take my left foot up.”

The master said, “But you were free. In the beginning you could have taken the left foot up. There was no binding order. You were completely free to choose whether to take the left foot up or the right foot up. I had not said anything about it; you just decided. You took the right foot up.

“You made it impossible for the left foot to be lifted up. Don’t bother about fate, kismet, God. Just think of simple things.”

① kismet [ˈkɪzmet] n. 命运，天数

② disrespectful [ˌdɪsrɪ'spektfl] a. 无礼的，失礼的

一个人来到一位大师面前向其请教人到底有多独立，多自由。他是完全自由的还是受一定的限制呢？是不是有诸如天数、天命、定数和神的存在令人不自由呢？

大师说：“站起来。”

这个人一定觉得这是一个蠢透了的答案，“我问他一个简单的问题他却叫我站起来。”但是他还是站了起来。大师说：“现在，抬起一条腿。”

到这时，这个人一定认为他来到了一个疯子面前，这和自由、独立有什么关系吗？但是既然已经来了……而且这位大师如此地受人尊敬，不按照他的意思做会很无礼，况且这又没什么害处。所以，他从地上抬起了一条腿，一只脚悬在空中，另一只脚独立着。

然后这位大师说：“非常好。还有，现在把左脚也抬起来。”

“那不可能！”这个人说，“你在要求不可能办到的事。我已经抬起了右脚，现在我不可能再把左脚抬起来。”

大师说：“但是你是自由的。开始你可以抬起左脚，没有任何的限制。你完全有自由去决定是抬左脚还是右脚，关于这点我没有做任何要求，完全由你决定。但你抬起了右脚。

“是你令自己不可能抬起左脚的。不要烦心命运、定数和神，想些简单的事情。” 

自由的枷锁是自己施加的，你原本就很自由……

## 4. Thief or treasurer?  小偷还是司库？

Once there was a thief and he was looking for things to steal in a temple where the Priest was giving a religious speech on the topic of truthfulness to many people. The thief was completely lost in the true feeling of truthfulness. When the program was over everybody went home except for the thief who was not ready to leave.

The thief wondered how a thief could become free from not speaking a lie. The Priest gave deep advice to him that by speaking truth also he would do his business. By using the virtue of truthfulness also he would remain safe and secure no matter where he was or what he stole. The thief firmly determined to follow the Priest’s advice in the practical life and promised to follow the norm of truthfulness and honesty from that day in all respects. 

As making the promise not to speak a lie in his life when the thief was going out from there, at the same time, the King disguised in an ordinary form was roaming① there to look after the atmosphere of the capital city. Coincidentally② the thief met a person on the way in a roaming condition. The roaming gentleman asked the thief who he was. The thief recalled his promise to always speak the truth, even though difficult, he still revealed that he was a thief. 

The gentleman replied happily and excitedly that he was also a thief. These two men became friends by handshaking and hugging with each other. The new thief suggested that they steal some very valuable things, and he knew exactly where to find them. He took him in such incognito③ way that both of them arrived in front of the Grand Royal Palace. As the security personnel asked who they were and where they were going, both of them replied that they were going into the palace to steal diamonds. The security guard did not know why they were so angry without any cause. 

The new thief friend took him to a shelf in a beautiful big drawing room. After breaking open the safe④, they found five most valuable diamonds. They took four and left one diamond there in the opened safe because they thought breaking one diamond in half would be valueless. 

Both of them went out with two diamonds on their hands just packed in the cloth for each. They again returned in the same gate and went out with replying that they were thieves. 

The next day as the royal palace offices were opened, they found the royal treasure of the palace was broken. The King then ordered the security guards to arrest the thief, and bring him to the King. After bringing him in the palace they presented the thief before the King. The King carefully observed him from his feet to head and said, “How many diamonds did you steal?” 

“We stole four; two for each of us. Since we could not break the last one in half, we left one diamond in the safe.”

The King then asked to the treasurer, “How many diamonds are missing?”

“All five, Your Majesty.”

The King immediately fired the treasurer and appointed the thief as the new treasurer for his commitment to always being truthful.  

① roam [rəʊm] v. 闲逛，漫步

② coincidentally [kəʊˌɪnsɪ'dentəlɪ] ad. 巧合地，碰巧地

③ incognito [ˌɪnkɒgˈni:təʊ] a. 隐姓埋名的，化名的

④ safe [seɪf] n. 保险箱

从前，有一个小偷在一个教堂里寻找目标伺机下手。此时，牧师正在教堂里布道，宣讲以诚待人。小偷大受感动，以至于当布道结束的时候，大家都回家去了，只有他还没有要离开的意思。

小偷想知道一个小偷怎样才能不说谎。牧师给了他意味深长的建议：即便是偷东西也是可以说真话的。利用诚实这一美德，无论他在哪里或者偷了什么，他也都可以平安无事。小偷下定决心在现实生活中按照牧师的建议去做，并承诺从那以后在各个方面都践行诚实。

小偷从教堂出来，他承诺以后在生活中不再说谎。与此同时，国王打扮成普通人模样在都城里闲逛，以便视察民情。碰巧的是，小偷在路上遇到了一个闲逛的人。那位闲逛的绅士问起小偷的身份，小偷想起了他的承诺——始终都要讲真话，所以尽管很难说出口，他还是坦白说他是一个小偷。

那位绅士兴奋地回答说他也是一个小偷。两个人相互握手拥抱并结为朋友。新小偷建议他们去偷一些值钱的东西，而且他确切地知道那些东西藏在哪里。他隐瞒了自己的身份带着小偷抵达了王宫。当侍卫盘问他们是谁，要到哪里去时，他们俩都回答说他们要进入王宫去偷钻石。侍卫不知道为什么他们会无缘无故这么生气。

新小偷带着他来到一个美丽的大厅，他们走到一个架子前，砸开保险柜后，发现里面有五颗珍贵的钻石。他们拿走了四颗，剩了一颗留在开着的保险柜里，因为他们认为把一颗钻石分成两半将毫无价值。

他们俩离开了大厅，手上分别拿着仅仅用布包裹着的两颗钻石。他们再次返回到之前的大门，回答侍卫说他们是小偷，并且出去了。

第二天，王宫办事处开门了，他们发现宫殿中的皇家瑰宝被人破门而入偷走了。国王立即下令侍卫逮捕小偷，并带来见他。他们把小偷带到宫殿面见国王陛下，国王从头到脚将小偷仔细地打量一番，说：“你偷了几颗钻石？” 

“我们偷了四颗，每人两颗。因为没有办法将最后那颗钻石分成两半，我们就没有拿。”

国王又问司库：“有几颗钻石失窃？”

“五颗全部失窃，尊贵的国王陛下。”

国王立即解雇了司库，并任命小偷为新的司库，因为他履行了他的承诺——始终做到诚实。

即使你曾经犯过错，诚实也会令你自由。

## 5. My heart's in the Highlands 我的心呀在高原

My heart’s in the Highlands, my heart is not here;

My heart’s in the Highlands a-chasing the deer,

A-chasing the wild deer, and following the roe①,

My heart’s in the Highlands wherever I go.

Farewell to the Highlands, farewell to the North,

The birthplace of valor②, the country of worth;

Wherever I wander, wherever I rove③,

The hills of the Highlands for ever I love!

Farewell to the mountains high covered with snow!

Farewell to the straths④ and green valleys below!

Farewell to the forests and wild hanging woods!

Farewell to the torrents and loud-pouring floods!

My heart’s in the Highlands, my heart is not here;

My heart’s in the Highlands a-chasing the deer,

A-chasing the wild deer, and following the roe,

My heart’s in the Highlands wherever I go.

① roe [rəʊ] n. 狍

② valor ['vælə] n. 英勇，勇猛

③ rove [rəʊv] v. 漂泊

④ strath [stræθ] n. 山谷

我的心呀在高原，我的心不在这里；

追逐着那野鹿，追逐着那野狍，

我的心呀在高原，无论我身在何方。

再见吧，高原，再见吧，北国，

这里是勇士的故乡，这里是美德的沃土；

无论我到哪儿流浪，无论我漂泊何方，

高原的群山是我永远的热爱！

再见了，白雪皑皑的山峰！

再见了，青翠的山谷与河滩！

再见了，枝条横斜的森林！

再见了，汹涌咆哮的洪波与急流！

我的心呀在高原，我的心不在这里；

我的心呀在高原，追逐着那鹿儿，

追逐着那野鹿，追逐着那野狍，

我的心呀在高原，无论我身在何方。

我的心呀在高原，追逐着那鹿儿……

## 6. A good knight's sleep 骑士的酣眠

There was a tavern①, located somewhere in the State of Apathy②, where knights and damsels, wizards and monks, could all eat and drink together and escape the evil outside, which was depressing and bewildering, to say the least. No one had the desire to do anything about anything in the State of Apathy, except escape the reality that they lived day after day and the only place to do that was the tavern.

The tavern was owned and operated by the government and the drinks were free. The government did not want the people to concern themselves with the unjust wars they were fighting, the innocent civilians that were being killed. With the townspeople so focused on their own lives, the government of the State of Apathy could do all of its evil works under the cloak of darkness, while the people made merry.

The townspeople were mesmerized③ by the steady flow of lies they were receiving from their dark government and the tedium of their own lives.

The knights, who could have uprooted④ the evil government, were living it up in the tavern, drinking, laughing and making merry and no one seemed to care, until the day.

The day came like any other day. The evil government, attacked one foreign land too many, which outraged the world, who gathered their forces and made war with the State of Apathy, invading their land, killing it’s people and treating them the way they had treated captives of other nations.

As the people of the State of Apathy cried out for a champion to rise up and defend them, there was only silence. Most of the townspeople were now captives themselves and now cared for the first time, in a long time about something other than their merriment. Now that they were awakened from their slumber⑤, they could begin planning how they were going to escape from their oppressors. But they had to plan at night, because during the day they were slaves.  

① tavern [ˈtævən] n. 酒馆

② apathy [ˈæpəθi] n. 冷漠

③ mesmerize [ˈmezməraɪz] v. 施催眠术 

④ uproot [ˌʌpˈru:t] v. 根除

⑤ slumber [ˈslʌmbə(r)] n. 睡眠

在冷漠之国的某个地方，有一家酒馆。在那里，骑士和少女，术士和僧侣，都可以在一起尽情地大吃大喝，如此至少可以躲避外边那令人沮丧又令人困惑的罪恶世界。在冷漠之国，除了逃避日复一日的现实生活，人们不想做任何事情。而逃避现实的唯一去处就是这家酒馆。

这家酒馆归政府所有并且由政府经营，里面酒水全部免费。政府不希望人民关注他们正在参与的不道义的战争，关心那些被杀害的无辜平民。因为人们的注意力都集中在自己的生活上，所以当他们在尽情欢愉之时，冷漠之国的政府却在暗地里干尽了伤天害理之事。

黑暗政府连篇累牍的谎言和生活的枯燥无味迷惑了人们。

本来可以将邪恶的政府铲除的骑士们，却在酒馆里声色犬马——酗酒、嬉闹和玩乐。似乎没有人在意政府的所作所为，直到有一天……

这一天的到来就如往常的每天一样。邪恶的政府多次出兵攻打他国，激起了天下的公愤。大家联合兵力对付冷漠之国，攻城略地，屠杀人民，用他们对待别国俘虏的同样方式来对待他们。

当冷漠之国的人民呼吁一名英雄揭竿而起保护他们的时候，全国却是万马齐喑。如今大部分的国民都成了俘虏。此前很长一段时间里，除了享乐，他们从来不在意任何事情，现在却不得不去关心了。既然从逃避的沉睡中苏醒过来了，他们便开始筹划如何从他们的压迫者手里逃出去。但是，他们不得不在晚上暗中谋划，因为在白天，他们是奴隶。

面前是残酷的现实，也不要逃避去沉睡，勇敢地面对，创造和守护属于你的自由。

## 7. Liberty is order 自由就是秩序  

Liberty is order. Liberty is strength. Look around the world, and admire, as you must, the instructive spectacle. You will see that liberty not only is power and order, but that it is power and order predominant① and invincible② — that it derides all other sources of strength. 

And shall the preposterous③ imagination be fostered, that men bred in liberty — the first of humankind who asserted the glorious distinction of forming for themselves their social compact — can be condemned to silence upon their rights? Is it to be conceived that men who have enjoyed, for such a length of days, the light and happiness of freedom, can be restrained, and shut up again in the gloom of ignorance and degradation④? 

As well, sir, might you try, by a miserable dam, to shut up the flowing of a rapid river! The rolling and impetuous⑤ tide would burst through every impediment that man might throw in its way; and the only consequence of the impotent⑥ attempt would be, that, having collected new force by its temporary suspension, enforcing itself through new channels, it would spread devastation⑦ and ruin on every side.

The progress of liberty is like the progress of the stream. Kept within its bounds, it is sure to fertilize the country through which it runs; but no power can arrest it in its passage; and short-sighted, as well as wicked, must be the heart of the projector that would strive to divert its course.

① predominant [prɪˈdɒmɪnənt] a. 占支配地位的

② invincible [ɪnˈvɪnsəbl] a. 不可征服的

③ preposterous [prɪˈpɒstərəs] a. 荒谬的

④ degradation [ˌdegrəˈdeɪʃn] n. 堕落，降级

⑤ impetuous [ɪmˈpetʃuəs] a. 猛烈的，激烈的

⑥ impotent [ˈɪmpətənt] a. 无力的，无效的

⑦ devastation [ˌdevəˈsteɪʃn] n. 毁坏

自由就是秩序，自由就是力量，放眼寰宇，你不得不为具有启发意义的景象赞美。你会发现自由不仅仅是力量和秩序，而且是主导的，不可征服的力量和秩序，它使一切其它的力量源泉都相形见绌。

难道能助长这种荒谬的幻觉吗？在自由中被哺育的人们——人类中第一批坚持认为自己享有订立社会契约的殊荣的人们——难道会被宣告对自己的权利缄默不语吗？难道能想象出在自由的光芒与幸福中沐浴已久的人们，能够被压制，并重新陷入无知和堕落的深渊吗？

是的，先生，你完全可以试着用一道可怜的堤坝去围堵奔腾湍急的河流！翻腾的急流会冲垮人们设置在河道上的任何障碍物，这种于事无补的尝试的唯一后果便是：河水由于暂时的停留而积聚了新生力量，它强行冲破新的河道，使两岸损毁惨重。

自由的进程如同河流。它保持在自己的活动范围内，必然会使流经的土地肥沃，但是，任何势力都无法阻碍它按照自己的路径前进，那些力图改变其路径的谋划者必定目光短浅，招人憎恶。

自由是不可征服的力量和秩序。

## 8. Being in the present  活在现在

When we talk about self improvement, we often talk about mastery of success. But if success comes at a high emotional① toll②, it can often turn into a failure. In our life we usually either live in the future, always thinking of things to come, or in the past, where our memories hunt us, day after day. It is very rare that we put all our energy in living in the present and enjoy the emotional freedom this brings.

When we spend time only planning or dreaming about things that didn’t happen yet, we often forget things that are extremely important right now. For example:

Let’s say that you are always thinking on how you are going on a vacation, and how wonderful it will be, and all the adventures you are going to have. Meanwhile, in the present, you work 7 days a week and are extremely stressed. You are so stressed, as a matter of fact, that you do not see how you can take a vacation at all. In your head the thoughts of vacation become a dream that is fading③ further and further away. It becomes a sort of an escape from your grim④ reality. 

Now let’s look at the same scenario⑤ with a different twist. When you start having thoughts of a vacation, you realize that you work really hard, and you can not afford to let that kind of stress rule your life. So you do everything possible to take time off and make that vacation a reality. Being in the present gave you emotional freedom that didn’t cloud your judgment. 

Past can be dangerous, if we spend most of our time there instead of living in the present. Here is an example of that: 

You just went through a break up of a long term relationship, but you can’t let go. It hunts you. You find yourself constantly thinking of your ex., analyzing what could have been, thinking about the reasons why the relationship ended. This makes you very unhappy.

Same scenario with a different outlook would be like that. The relationship is over. You mourn; go through all the necessary stages, but soon you realize that it was for the best. You look at your present situation and see that it is a new beginning for you. You start dating again and realize that it can be a lot of fun. You shed the old hair style, your old wardrobe. You become a new person simply by realizing your present situation and letting go of the past. Here emotional freedom allowed you to let go of the past and successfully move on. 

This ability is so crucial that developing only that one skill will propel your life to unbelievable heights of success. In order for us to be able to do everything we need to in our day-to-day activities, we need to feel good. Nothing makes us feel good as not being preoccupied by the thoughts and emotions of things that passed or did not even happen yet. This skill is invaluable in the success toolbox of our self improvement.

① emotional [ɪˈməʊʃənl] a. 情感的

② toll [təʊl] n. 代价

③ fade [feɪd] v. 枯萎，衰退

④ grim [grɪm] a. 严酷的

⑤ scenario [səˈnɑ:riəʊ] n. 某一特定情景


当我们谈论自我完善时，我们谈论更多的是把握成功。但如果成功是以大量的情感为代价，往往可能变成失败。在我们的一生中，我们通常要么生活在未来——总是想着将要发生的事情，要么生活在过去——记忆萦绕在我们脑海之中，日复一日。而我们把所有的精力都用在现在的生活并且享受其所带来的情感自由的时候却是非常罕见的。

当我们总是把时间花在规划或者梦想还没有发生的事情的时候，我们常常会忘记此刻非常重要的事情。例如：

假设你一直在设想着你将如何去度假，这个假期将会如何地美妙以及你即将经历的所有的冒险活动。与此同时，你现在每周工作7天而且压力极大。事实上，你的压力已经大到你根本无法预见到你将如何去度假。于是你脑海中度假的想法变成了一个逐渐凋零的梦，它演变成了你对严酷现实的某种逃避。

现在让我们看看在相同的情境下截然不同的表现吧。当你开始有度假的想法时，你意识到你工作真的很辛苦，你不能让这种压力控制你的生活。所以你尽一切可能抽出一部分时间去度假。活在现在给了你情感自由，那并不会影响你的判断。

如果我们大部分的时间都花在回想过去而不是生活在现在，一样很危险。这里就有一个例子：

你刚刚经历了一场多年的恋爱，最终分手了，但你不能释怀。这种感觉困扰着你。你发现你不断地想起你的前男（女）友，不断地分析原本应该怎么样，不断地思考感情结束的原因。这使你非常苦恼。

同样的情境但是不同的观点将会是这样的：感情结束了，你怀念它，经历了所有必要的阶段，你很快意识到这也许不是件坏事。你考虑目前的情况，发现这对你来说是一个新的开始。你又开始约会，并意识到生活可以有无穷的乐趣。你换掉旧的发型，旧的衣柜。只不过因为你认识到了目前的情况并且放下了过去，你就焕然一新了。在这一点上，情感自由让你放下了过去并且顺利地继续前行。

这种能力是如此的重要，以至于仅仅培养这一种能力将会提升你的生活，令其达到一个令人难以置信的成功高度。为了让我们能够做到我们在日常活动中需要做的一切，我们要心情愉快。如果思绪和情感没有被过去或者将来的事情全部占据，我们的心情就会非常愉快。在我们成功地达到自我完善的技能中，这种技能是无价的。

在情感上放自己自由，去改善你今天和明天的生活……
