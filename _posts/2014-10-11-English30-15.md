# 第十五天

## 抱怨 (Complaints)

### (一) 会话

#### 对话1(Dialogue 1)

Tom: I’d to wait quite a while for the bus today, there seem to be fewer buses nowadays.

John: Not fewer buses, but more people.

Tom: Yes, too many people. It’s really a problem. We’re packed in like sardines and we have to go through that twice a day.

John: Yesterday I went to Nanjing Road and was shocked to see the crowds. It was difficult to move. I couldn’t even squeeze into some of the store.

#### 对话2(Dialogue 2)

Salesman: Good morning, may I help you?

Tom: Yes, I bought this picnic basket here about a week ago, and I’m sorry to say I’m very dissatisfied with it.

Salesman: Oh? What’s wrong?

Tom: Just about everything. It’s badly made. The quality’s terrible.

Salesman: Could I have a look at it?

Tom: Sure. Now look at this handle. I went on a picnic the day before yesterday. I was carrying the basket and the handle came off! The whole basket fell to the ground, and the thermos in the basket broke.

Salesman: Mm… it’s full of coffee stains.

Tom: Yes, and it’s supposed to be waterproof! I’m annoyed and I’d like my money back.

Salesman: Well, I certainly understand how you feel, but I’m afraid we don’t give money back on reduced items. Remember, it was reduced from $40 to $30.

Tom: But…

Salesman: Do you have the receipt?

Tom: Here it is.

Salesman: Maybe you’d like to choose some thing else for the same price?

Tom: Well, I would prefer to have my money back. May I see the manager?

Salesman: I’m very sorry, but he’s not here at the moment. Could you come back later?

Tom: All right. I’ll come again in the afternoon.
