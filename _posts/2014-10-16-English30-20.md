# 第二十天

## 看医生(Seeing the Doctor)

### （一）会话

#### 对话1(Dialogue 1)

A: Good morning.

B: Good morning, Doctor.

A: Well, what’s the trouble?

B: I feel hot and feverish, Doctor. I’ve got a terrible sore throat.

A: Yes.

B: It’s possible flu, but I thought I’d better see you.

A: Quite right. Now, let me have a look at you. If you could slip off your coat and blouse, I’d like to listen to your chest. Sit straight up. Cross your arms. That’s it. Now breathe in. A deep breath. That’s it. Cough. Now again. Sit up. Fine. That’s all, now, you slip on your blouse again.

B: My eyes have been sore and painful, Doctor.

A: Have they? Now I’ll just take your temperature. Just put it under your tongue. That’s it.

(After a while)

A: Now, let me have a look. It is a bit high. Now, I want to examine your throat. Open wide.  Say“Ah”. 

B: Aaaaahh, Aaaaaahh.

A: Yes, t does look a bit sore. But there’s nothing to be alarmed about. A slight infection. You’d better have a couple of days in bed.

B: What about the throat?

A: I’m giving you a course of anti-biotics. Take one capsule every four hours. Here’s the prescription.

B: Thank you, Doctor. Good-bye.
